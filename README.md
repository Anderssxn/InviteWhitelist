# InviteList

**Maintain security and an active community by allowing pre-existing server members to invite other players to the whitelist.**

InviteList is a modern, high-performance whitelist management plugin for Paper/Spigot servers that empowers your community to grow organically. Instead of manually managing a whitelist, let your trusted players invite new members while maintaining full control and tracking.

## üåê Multi-Server Setup

### Setting Up Shared Whitelist

1. **Install MySQL/MariaDB** on a dedicated server or hosting service

2. **Create database and user:**

   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE invitelist;
   CREATE USER 'invitelist'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'your_secure_password';
   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON invitelist.* TO 'invitelist'@'%';
   FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
   ```

3. **Update config.yml** on ALL servers:

   ```yaml
   database:
     type: "mysql"
     mysql:
       host: "your.mysql.server"
       port: 3306
       database: "invitelist"
       username: "invitelist"
       password: "your_secure_password"
       max-pool-size: 10

   cache:
     auto-refresh: true
     refresh-interval-seconds: 30 # Faster sync for multi-server
   ```

4. **Migrate existing data** (if needed):

   ```
   # On one server with existing SQLite data:
   /invitelist migrate
   ```

5. **Restart all servers** or reload database:
   ```
   /invitelist reload database
   ```

## üéØ Performance

InviteList is designed for high-performance servers:

- **In-Memory Caching**: Whitelist lookups happen in O(1) time from RAM
- **Async Operations**: Database writes never block the main thread
- **Connection Pooling**: Efficient HikariCP database connections
- **Optimized Queries**: Prepared statements and batch operations
- **Scalable Architecture**: Tested with 100K+ whitelisted players

### Performance Tips

- **Single Server**: Use SQLite with 300s cache refresh (default)
- **Multi-Server**: Use MySQL with 30-60s cache refresh
- **High-Traffic**: Use MySQL with 10-30s cache refresh and higher pool size

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Players can't join after being invited

- **Check cache status**: `/invitelist cache`
- **Verify player is whitelisted**: `/invitelist list`
- **Force cache refresh**: `/invitelist reload database`
- **Check cache interval**: Lower `refresh-interval-seconds` in config

### MySQL connection issues

- Verify MySQL is running and accessible
- Check firewall rules (port 3306)
- Test credentials manually
- Check MySQL user permissions
- Review server logs for detailed error messages

### Migration failed

- Ensure MySQL is configured correctly in `config.yml`
- Verify MySQL connection before migrating
- Check console for detailed error messages
- Make sure MySQL user has CREATE/INSERT permissions

### Cache not updating across servers

- Reduce `refresh-interval-seconds` (try 30-60s)
- Verify all servers use the same MySQL database
- Check network latency between servers and database
- Ensure system clocks are synchronized (NTP)

## üìä Database Schema

InviteList automatically creates and manages these tables:

### `whitelist` Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE whitelist (
    uuid VARCHAR(36) PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(16) NOT NULL,
    invited_by VARCHAR(36),
    invited_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### `invitations` Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE invitations (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    inviter_uuid VARCHAR(36),
    invited_uuid VARCHAR(36),
    invited_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```
